# Tech Blog
![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)

## Description
This application is a CMS-style blog site that allows users to write posts about tech and engage with other user's posts by adding comments to them. In addition to creating new posts and comments, users are also able to edit and delete their posts and comments. 

In order to fully engage with the application by posting and commenting, users must create an account. However, users may view all posts and comments on the blog without being logged in. 

This application was built using MVC framework, with Handlebars.js as the templating engine. It also uses Sequelize as the ORM and the express-session npm package for session authentication.
